            <p>For years before the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump railed against U.S. free trade deals, claiming that they move jobs overseas. Once the businessman became the candidate, his rhetoric against trade deals heated up significantly—it became a cornerstone of his successful presidential bid. Trump’s anti-trade message—and a similar anti-globalist tone coming from Bernie Sanders in the primaries—even succeeded in turning political will against Trans-Pacific Partnership, a mega-deal years in the making with countries around the Pacific rim. Senator Charles Schumer, the upcoming Senate minority leader, announced after the election that TPP was now dead.</p>

            <p>Trump’s followers seemed to echo his antipathy to trade—but were these voters coming from places where jobs had actually been lost due to trade deals? The degree to which trade deals have resulted in job loss is difficult to ascertain. But there is one good metric to see where different industries have been generally affected by trade: the Department of Labor’s Trade Adjustment Assistance.</p>

            <p>TAA was first introduced in the 1960s to allow workers affected negatively by trade deals to apply for government assistance. Department of Labor investigators look into their claims, and decide whether or not their claim is valid. The following data is gathered from valid petitions (workers that have successfully convinced the government that trade has affected their work status) since 1994, when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was passed.</p> 

            <p>Do these workers live in the areas that supported Donald Trump?</p>

            <p>At first glance, then, it might seem like support for Trump and areas that have lost jobs are correlated—after all, it was Rust Belt swing states like Michigan and Ohio that helped push him past the 270 elector mark. But a closer look at a few test cases shows that the connection is not that simple.</p>
 
            <p>Starting with the top, the five cities with the most certified trade adjustment petitions are: New York City, El Paso, Houston, Portland (OR) and Dallas. Of course, it makes sense that larger cities would lose more jobs—but El Paso, which had the second-highest petitions (245) is not a large city by any measure.</p>
 
            <p>With 700,000 residents, El Paso is a third the size of Houston. In the mid-1990’s, workers in its textile industry were hit hard by factories moving overseas. Levi Strauss alone closed eight plants in El Paso in the 90’s. VJ Jeanwear—a company that owns brands such as Wrangler, Timberland and The North Face—followed suit in the early 2000s.</p>
 
            <p>And yet, El Paso voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. Trump garnered a measly 25.9 percent of the vote, losing by a whopping 43 points. El Paso’s turnout shows that, in some places, race and ethnicity are better electoral indicators than economics: El Paso is roughly 80 percent Hispanic or Latino. Nationwide, exit polls suggest that Latinos voted for Hillary Clinton at around the same 70/30 split as El Paso.</p>

            <p>But other areas show that job loss due to trade may have had a big impact in Trump’s favor. Pennsylvania has seen more trade adjustment petitions certified than any other state (2,442) since NAFTA—which amounts to thousands and thousands of jobs lost due to trade. Unlike other states, Pennsylvania’s jobs have continued to steadily leave throughout the 2010s; one trade adjustment petition, for workers at Union Electric Akers in Avonmore, was certified on November 3, just a week before the election.</p>
 
            <p>The case of Erie, PA shows just how powerful this employment flight can be. Although it has fifteen times fewer people than Philadelphia, Erie is tied with Philly for the most petitions in the state. Workers filing the petitions came from the classic heavy industries that have been gutted since the 1970s: General Electric, 3M and Erie Forge and Steel. It would be hard to argue that this phenomenon didn’t help Trump—Erie, which had long been a Democratic stronghold, voted for Trump by a margin of just 2,300 votes. Pennsylvania, with its 20 coveted electoral college votes, decided in his favor by a mere 45,000 votes.</p>
