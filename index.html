            <p>For years before the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump railed against U.S. free trade deals, claiming that they move jobs overseas. Once the businessman became the candidate, his rhetoric against trade deals heated up significantly—it became a cornerstone of his successful presidential bid. Trump’s anti-trade message—and a similar anti-globalist tone coming from Bernie Sanders in the primaries—even succeeded in turning political will against Trans-Pacific Partnership, a mega-deal years in the making with countries around the Pacific rim. Senator Charles Schumer, the upcoming Senate minority leader, announced after the election that TPP was now dead.</p>

            <p>Trump’s followers seemed to echo his antipathy to trade—but were these voters coming from places where jobs had actually been lost due to trade deals? The degree to which trade deals have resulted in job loss is difficult to ascertain. But there is one good metric to see where different industries have been generally affected by trade: the Department of Labor’s Trade Adjustment Assistance.</p>

            <p>TAA was first introduced in the 1960s to allow workers affected negatively by trade deals to apply for government assistance. Department of Labor investigators look into their claims, and decide whether or not their claim is valid. The following data is gathered from valid petitions (workers that have successfully convinced the government that trade has affected their work status) since 1994, when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was passed.</p> 

            <p>Do these workers live in the areas that supported Donald Trump?</p>
